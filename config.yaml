    content: |-
      With a background in cognitive science, computer science, and mathematics, I am deeply interested in the intersection of technology, art, and human behavior. My professional journey combines elements of scientific inquiry with creativity and collaboration. Whether through producing music, analyzing data, or designing user-focused technology, I strive to bridge the gap between technical skill and human experience.
